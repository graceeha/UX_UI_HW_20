                        We began our research by first conducting a competitor analysis and heuristic evaluation of the
                        website. Just by reviewing the website alone gave us many ideas as to what areas we can improve
                        greatly on. At first glance, it’s quite obvious that the website had not been updated in years
                        and the designer at the time probably didn’t take the time to look at it from a user’s point of
                        view.
                        <br>
                        As for the competitor’s analysis, our team member Shivani, researched 2 direct and 2 indirect
                        competitors to see what areas we could consider incorporating into the website. Using the
                        competitors’ negative reviews helped guide our direction as well as taking into consideration
                        how much of an impact social media and partnerships have on an organization’s validity in the
                        modern world.
                        Despite the term “competitor”, we should rather see other nonprofits as sister organizations as
                        they all try to achieve similar goals for bettering the lives of unfortunate animals. We
                        followed their footsteps to see what works and what doesn’t as well as see how we can go above
                        what they have already so that we can attract more attention by doing something differently. We
                        also attempted to contact the organization’s leader(s), but it took 2 weeks to get a reponse
                        from them letting us know that they were not interested in redesigning the site. It was
                        unfortunate, but our group still took this project as a great learning experience.

                        We delegated the work amongst ourselves for the majority of the project period. Interview and
                        survey questions were created by select members and the team as a whole would iterate on them or
                        add in additional questions that could be used in the interviews. We conducted a total of 8 user
                        interviews and ran one survey which produced 16 responses.
                        We focused the user insights into 3 broad categories: pet adoptions, the Angel Cat website, as
                        well as possible improvements. We found that research into pet adoptions primarily start on the
                        online platform and not everyone who wants to adopt always knows exactly how to care for the
                        pet. This tells us that making a good first impression on the user is what makes or breaks their
                        decision to trust the website. As it stands currently, most people expressed that they would not
                        trust this website based on appearance alone.
                        Regarding the website’s look, it was apparent that the site’s design needed an upgrade, but some
                        users quite liked the nostalgic feeling it gave off based on the color and use of old gifs
                        primarily used perhaps a decade ago. Users found the adoption application too long and
                        “intidimidating”.
                        Taking careful consideration of all of our user interviews and survey results, we determine
                        dthat we must focus our work on the following: streamlined homepage, better choice of
                        typography, more call to action buttons, better application process, and more imagery of cats!

                        Please meet our user persona, Amy McDowell! We developed this user persona based on the
                        interview and survey results and insights, although in hindsight, a persona with a small family
                        would also have been a good option if we had developed a second persona.
                        As cats are mainly kept indoors and are low maintenance in comparison to dogs, we thought of our
                        persona as someone who either prefers to be indoors majority of the time or for some reason is
                        required to be indoors for external reasons. In this case, we took the world’s current situation
                        with coronavirus into consideration. The pandemic has left people with many hardships, one of
                        which is loneliness in the midst of isolation.
                        In Amy’s case, she works from home and missed the physical closeness she had with friends and
                        family before the pandemic. You never really know what you have until it’s gone, and Amy
                        realizes this for herself now. Since she has more time available during quarantine, she decides
                        to fulfill one of her long time wishes which is to adopt a cat, but she is unsure where to
                        start. She is the type of person who likes to donate her money to places where they will be of
                        help, and she prefers to donate to small local organizations as they need the most help. Her
                        friend helps her discover Angel Cat Pet Adoptions

                        Despite pursuing what she wants, Amy knows that nothing ever comes easy, and she is feeling a
                        bit worried about the application process in order to adopt a cat. She understands the necessity
                        for providing a lot of information, but she is hoping that it is a process that is not just
                        asking her for information but also one that guides her as she is a first time cat owner. As all
                        nonprofits rely on donations, we also wanted to allow Amy to feel encouraged to donate to this
                        website upon its redesign.

                        Our primary focus was creating a connection between the user and organization at the start of
                        the adoption process. Right now the current website only has you fill out the long application,
                        but doesn’t really give any indication of what will happen next. So we imagined the user is
                        feeling confused and unsure at this point. We want to remove those negative emotions.

                        Making sure that information is structured appropriate is important so that user’s are not
                        confused about where they are and what they can do. We did not have much to dissect from our
                        chosen site as they utlized only a very basic navigation structure. After gathering all the
                        information topics, we developed a sitemap to give an overall view of what can be expected to be
                        on each page.

                        Our project, at first, had a lot of ideas but no certain direction. While we were trying to
                        figure out what exactly to do, we ended up going through quite a few rounds of iterations. Many
                        days we stayed up late, but it was well worth the time and effort.

                        Not only did we simply try to add on to a wireframe skeleton with color and text, but we also
                        tried to have more than one member design a few wireframes to see more options to take into
                        consideration. The more the merrier in this case.

                        After many late nights and quite a few cups of coffee and tea, our group was able to produce a
                        high fidelity prototype for Angel Cat Pet Adoptions that can grab the attention of newcomers and
                        give a sense of welcoming and friendliness.
                        In addition to the website prototype, we also designed a RWD mobile design to show how the site
                        can be easily accessible to mobile users.

                        Every design process is always a humbling experience. To remind myself that I must think as a designer separately from a user can be a challenge especially when I feel that I can relate to our user persona. Understanding that nothing is really a finished product because of continuous iterations to fit the users’ needs is something that I appreciate as this process shows great empathy for the user. 
                        In future development for this website’s redesign (ideally if the organization were to change their mind and take interest in revamping their site which is their greatest asset in connecting to the community) would be to run usability tests to ensure a thorough mapping of the prototype and more interviews to validate the data we inititally obtained. Also, as mobile devices are one of the primary tools used in our generation and in the generations to come, I would work to build all desktop pages to be responsive on mobile and maybe even consider developing a mobile app if it could help satisfy the users’ needs and wants.
